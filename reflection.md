Reflection of Watermelon Problem


This problem is simple in its approach and solution and helped me flex the muscle in coding 
I don't get to use a lot: a straightforward problem solving with an elegant solution. I used my understanding of math 
to find the easiest way to find if a number can be divided evely which is if the number can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
Then I used if/else to sort the numbers into those divisable by two and those that aren't and return the output as instructed.
This solution allows for simplicity and efficiency. It also felt like an approachable problem to me, which I don't feel often
with the bigger coding assignments.
